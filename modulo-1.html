  <strong>Reflection on the Mind Map Activity</strong><br><br>
  This reflection is about a mind map that explored the concept of science. First, the task involved organizing disciplines into physical, biological, and social sciences.<br><br>
  In addition, the diagram helped show connections between fields like physics, medicine, psychology, and anthropology. As a result, I could structure ideas clearly.<br><br>
  One advantage was understanding how diverse areas contribute to studying reality. However, a difficulty was deciding where certain fields fit, as they sometimes overlap.<br><br>
  To sum up, it was a useful activity that helped consolidate knowledge and visualize science as a broad system of inquiry.

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <strong>Reflection on the Chemistry Class Presentation</strong><br><br>
  This reflection is about a digital presentation I made about Chemistry as a school subject. To start with, I chose this topic because Chemistry helps us understand matter and how it changes.<br><br>
  Then, preparing the presentation helped me organize ideas and explain them clearly. As a result, I could connect classroom content with real-life examples.<br><br>
  One advantage was learning more about how Chemistry is part of many fields. However, choosing what information to include was sometimes difficult.<br><br>
  To sum up, it was a useful activity that helped me reflect on Chemistry as an important and interesting subject.

    <img src="cientifico.jpg" alt="Scientific Report Reflection" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <strong>Reflection on the Scientific Report</strong><br><br>
  This reflection is about a report I wrote about a scientist. To start with, the task involved researching basic facts such as name, origin, education, profession, and achievements.<br><br>
  Personally, I found it motivating to explore the background and contributions of someone in the scientific field. Not only did I identify relevant personal and professional information, but I also highlighted achievements and explained how they influenced society and future research.<br><br>
  One valuable aspect was practicing research and organization skills, which I believe are essential both at school and beyond. On the other hand, checking reliable sources and summarizing all the data was complex and required extra attention.<br><br>
  To sum up, I firmly believe that this task helped me appreciate how individual scientists shape knowledge and impact the world. This understanding will be useful to me in future projects.

    <img src="problema.jpg" alt="Developing a Scientific Problem Reflection" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <strong>Reflection on Developing a Scientific Problem</strong><br><br>
  This reflection explores a project about the improper use of antibiotics and its impact on public health, which I found both timely and relevant.<br><br>
  I examined why people take them unnecessarily or don‚Äôt finish treatments, realizing this fuels resistant bacteria and complicates future medical responses. This made me reflect on how scientific knowledge directly connects with social responsibility.<br><br>
  It was valuable to connect science with real-life concerns, especially considering how personal behaviors shape collective outcomes. I firmly believe that this understanding could be useful to me in future decisions, both academic and personal.<br><br>
  The task helped me think critically about a pressing issue that calls for greater public awareness, and prompted me to consider how education might drive change. In short, this experience strengthened my ability to analyse problems and seek meaningful solutions.

  <h2 style="color: #2a5d84;">Final Reflection on the Module</h2>
  <p>
    During this module, I worked on topics that combine science and society, such as the improper use of antibiotics and bacterial resistance, which I found both timely and exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the process, I not only improved my ability to communicate complex ideas, but also reaffirmed my interest in understanding how knowledge can create awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
    I close this cycle with a more critical and engaged perspective, and with greater curiosity for what comes next.
