</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/healthyhabits-video.jpg" alt="Actividad 2">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the Healthy Habits Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity helped me identify key actions to improve my physical and mental well-being, such as eating healthy food, exercising, and sleeping well.

I also reflected on how technology can affect rest and how small habits can reduce stress.

One positive aspect was comparing what I already do with what I should improve.

To sum up, it was a useful task that reminded me to take care of my health every day.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/sportsverbs.jpg" alt="Actividad 3">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the Sports Verbs Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity helped me review the correct use of play, go and do with different sports.

I classified each sport according to its verb and created example sentences to practise them.

It was useful to reinforce grammar while expanding my sports vocabulary.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/whataboutyou.jpg" alt="Actividad 4">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “What About You?” Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity allowed me to describe my daily eating habits, identify healthy and unhealthy foods I usually eat, and reflect on my lifestyle.

I analysed how often I do certain activities and thought about possible changes to improve my health.

It was useful to connect vocabulary with my personal routine and to practise expressing opinions and suggestions in English.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/linkingwords.jpg" alt="Actividad 5">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “Linking Words and Expressions” Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity helped me classify linking words into categories such as addition, contrast, sequence, and reason.

I practised rewriting sentences by choosing the most appropriate connectors, improving fluency and coherence in writing.

It was useful to strengthen my understanding of how connectors shape ideas and guide the reader through a text.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/mydailyroutine.jpg" alt="Actividad 6">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “Daily Routine” Writing Test</strong><br><br>
  This test allowed me to develop a coherent text describing my daily routine, using appropriate verb tenses and time expressions.

I organised ideas in sequence and included details about habits, responsibilities, and leisure activities to create a complete narrative.

It was useful for improving my writing fluency and for practising how to connect actions logically throughout the day.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/nutrition.jpg" alt="Actividad 7">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “Nutrition” Activity</strong><br><br>

</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/modal.jpg" alt="Actividad 8">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “Modal (?)” Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity helped me practise the use of different modal verbs such as must, mustn’t, can, should, and have to in various contexts.

It was useful to strengthen my grammar and to make my answers more precise and appropriate for each situation.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-block">
  <img src="images/thehumanbody-video.jpg" alt="Actividad 9">
  <p><strong>Reflection on the “The Human Body” Activity</strong><br><br>
  This activity helped me review the main human body systems, their structures, and functions.

I completed diagrams, labelled parts, and classified systems according to their role in the body.

It was useful for connecting visual information with scientific vocabulary in English.</p>
</div>
